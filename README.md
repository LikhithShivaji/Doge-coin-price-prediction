# Dogecoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for Dogecoin price using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to forecast future price movements and trends, providing valuable insights for investors and stakeholders interested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

## Project Components

1. **Data Collection and Exploration:**
   - Gather historical Dogecoin price data from reliable sources.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and identify patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and irregularities.
   - Engineer relevant features that may enhance the model's predictive power.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Implement various machine learning algorithms suitable for time series prediction.
   - Experiment with different models such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.
   - Utilize techniques like grid search or random search to find the best configurations.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Consider additional evaluation metrics relevant to time series forecasting.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations to showcase model predictions against actual Dogecoin price movements.
   - Provide insights into trends, potential breakpoints, and other significant observations.
